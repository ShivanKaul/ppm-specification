--- abstract

There are many situations in which it is desirable to take
measurements of data which people consider sensitive.  In these cases,
the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in
people's individual responses but rather in aggregated data.
Conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then
aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and
rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.
This document describes a multi-party privacy preserving measurement (PPM)
protocol which can be used to collect aggregate data without
revealing any individual user's data.

# Introduction

This document describes a protocol for privacy preserving measurement.
The protocol is executed by a large set of clients and a small set of
servers. The servers' goal is to compute some aggregate statistic over
the clients' inputs without learning the inputs themselves. This is
made possible by distributing the computation among the servers in
such a way that, as long as at least one of them executes the protocol
honestly, no input is ever seen in the clear by any server.

## DISCLAIMER

This document is a work in progress. We have not yet settled on the design of
the protocol framework or the set of features we intend to support.

## Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used:

Aggregation function:
: The function computed over the users' inputs.

Aggregator:
: An endpoint that runs the input-validation protocol and accumulates
  input shares.

Batch:
: A set of reports that are aggregated into an output.

Batch size:
: The minimum number of reports in a batch.

Batch window:
: The minimum time difference between the oldest and newest report in
  a batch (in seconds).
  [[OPEN ISSUE: This is defined as maximum later
  https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-documents/issues/118]]

Client:
: The endpoint from which a user sends data to be aggregated, e.g., a
  web browser.

Collector:
: The endpoint that receives the output of the aggregation
  function.

Input:
: The measurement (or measurements) emitted by a client, before any
   encryption or secret sharing scheme is applied.

Input share:
: One of the shares output by feeding an input into a secret
  sharing scheme. Each share is to be transmitted to one of the participating
  aggregators.

Input validation protocol:
: The protocol executed by the client and aggregators in order to
   validate the client's input without leaking its value to the
   aggregators.

Measurement:
: A single value (e.g., a count) being reported by a client.
   Multiple measurements may be grouped into a single protocol input.

Leader:
: A distinguished aggregator that coordinates input validation and data
   collection.

Output:
: The output of the aggregation function over a given set of reports.

Output share:
: The share of an output emitted by an aggregator. Output shares
   can be reassembled by the leader into the final output.

Proof:
: A value generated by the client and used by the aggregators to verify
   the client's input.

Report:
: Uploaded to the leader from the client. A report contains the
   secret-shared and encrypted input and proof.

Server:
: An aggregator.

This document uses the protocol definition language of {{!RFC8446}}.

# Overview {#overview}

The protocol is executed by a large set of clients and a small set of
servers.  We call the servers the *aggregators*. Each client's input
to the protocol is a set of measurements (e.g., counts of some user
behavior). Given the input set of measurements `x_1, ..., x_n` held by
`n` users, the goal of a *privacy preserving measurement (PPM)
protocol* is to compute `y = F(x_1, ..., x_n)` for some aggregation
function `F` while revealing nothing else about the measurements.

This protocol is extensible and allows for the addition of new
cryptographic schemes that compute new functions. The current
version supports two schemes:

* Prio {{CB17}}, which allows for aggregate statistics such as
  sum, mean, histograms, etc. over a single value.

* Heavy Hitters {{BBCp21}}, which allows for finding the most
  common strings among a collection of clients (e.g., the
  URL of their home page) as well as counting the number of
  clients that hold a given string.

This protocol is designed to work with schemes that use secret
sharing. Rather than send its input in the clear, each client splits
its measurements into a sequence of *shares* and sends a share to each
of the aggregators. This provides two important properties:

* It's impossible to deduce the measurement without knowing *all* of the shares.

* It allows the aggregators to compute the final output by first
   aggregating up their measurements shares locally, then combining
   the results to obtain the final output.

[[OPEN ISSUE: This shows two helpers, but the document only allows one for now.
https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-documents/issues/117]]


The main participants in the protocol are as follows:

Collector:
: The entity which wants to take the measurement and ultimately receives
  the results. Any given measurement will have a single collector.

Client(s):
: The endpoints which directly take the measurement(s) and report them to the
  PPM system. In order to provide reasonable levels of privacy, there
  must be a large number of clients.

Aggregator:
: An endpoint which receives report shares. Each aggregator works with the
  other aggregators to compute the final aggregate. This protocol defines
  two types of aggregators: Leaders and Helpers. For each measurement,
  there is a single leader and helper.

Leader:
: The leader is responsible for coordinating the protocol. It receives
  the encrypted shares, distributes them to the helpers, and orchestrates
  the process of computing the final measurement as requested by
  the collector.

Helper:
: Helpers are responsible for executing the protocol as instructed
  by the leader. The protocol is designed so that helpers can be relatively
  lightweight, with most of the state held at the leader.
{:br}

The basic unit of PPM is the "task" which represents
a single measurement (though potentially taken over multiple
time wndows). The definition of a task includes the
following parameters:

* The values to be measured;
* The statistic to be computed (e.g., sum, mean, etc.);
* The set of aggregators and necessary cryptographic keying material to use; and
* The PPM scheme to use. This is to some extent dictated by the previous
  choices.
* The minimum "batch size" of reports which can be aggregated.
* The rate at which measurements can be taken, i.e., the "minimum batch window".

These parameters are distributed out of band to the clients and to
the aggregators. Each task is identified by a unique 32-byte ID
which is used to refer to it in protocol messages.

During the duration of the measurement, each client records its own
value(s), packages them up into a report, and sends them to the leader.
Each share is separately encrypted for each aggregator so that even
though they pass through the leader, the leader is unable to see or modify
them. Depending on the measurement, the client may only send one
report or may send many reports over time.

The leader distributes the shares to the helpers and orchestrates
the process of verifying them (see {{validating-inputs}})
and assembling them into a final measurement for the collector.
Depending on the PPM scheme, it may be possible to incrementally
process each report as it comes in, or may be necesary to wait
until the entire batch of reports is received.


## Validating Inputs {#validating-inputs}

An essential task of any data collection pipeline is ensuring that the input
data is "valid". In PPM, input validation is complicated by
the fact that none of the entities other than the client ever sees
the values for individual clients.

In order to address this problem, each PPM client generates a
zero-knowledge proof that its report is valid and attaches it to the
report. The aggregators can then jointly verify this proof prior to
incorporating the report in the aggregation and reject the report if
it cannot be verified. However, they do not learn anything about
the individual report other than that it is valid.

The specific properties attested to in the
proof vary depending on the measurement being taken. For instance, if
we want to measure the time the user took performing a given task the
proof might demonstrate that the value reported was within a certain
range (e.g., 0-60 seconds). By contrast, if we wanted to report which
of a set of N options the user select, the report might contain N
integers and the proof would demonstrate that N-1 were 0 and the other
was 1.

It is important to recogize that "validity" is distinct from "correctness".
For instance, the user might have spent 30s on a task but the client
might report 60s. This is a problem with any measurement system and
PPM does not attempt to address it; it merely ensures that the data
is within acceptable limits, so the client could not report 10^6s
or -20s.


# Message Transport

Communications between PPM entities are carried over HTTPS {{!RFC2818}}.
HTTPS provides server authentication and confidentiality. In addition,
report shares are encrypted directly to the aggregators using HPKE {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.

## Errors

Errors can be reported in PPM both at the HTTP layer and within
challenge objects as defined in {{iana-considerations}}.  PPM servers can return
responses with an HTTP error response code (4XX or 5XX).  For
example, if the client submits a request using a method not allowed
in this document, then the server MAY return status code 405 (Method
Not Allowed).

When the server responds with an error status, it SHOULD provide
additional information using a problem document {{!RFC7807}}.  To
facilitate automatic response to errors, this document defines the
following standard tokens for use in the "type" field (within the
PPM URN namespace "urn:ietf:params:ppm:error:"):

| Type                    | Description                                                                                  |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| unrecognizedMessage     | The message type for a response was incorrect or the payload was malformed. |
| unrecognizedTask        | An endpoint received a message with an unknown task ID. |
| outdatedConfig          | The message was generated using an outdated configuration. |

This list is not exhaustive.  The server MAY return errors
set to a URI other than those defined above.  Servers MUST NOT use the PPM URN
namespace for errors not listed in the appropriate IANA registry (see {{ppm-urn-space}}).
Clients SHOULD display the "detail" field of all errors.
The "instance" value MUST be the endpoint to which the request was
targeted. The problem document MUST also include a "taskid" member which contains
the associated PPM task ID (this value is always known, see {{task-configuration}}).

In the remainder of this document, we use the tokens in the table above to refer
to error types, rather than the full URNs.  For example, an "error of type
'unrecognizedMessage'" refers to an error document with "type" value
"urn:ietf:params:ppm:error:unrecognizedMessage".

This document uses the verbs "abort" and "alert with `[some error
message]`" to describe how protocol participants react to various
error conditions.


# Protocol Definition

PPM has three major interactions which need to be defined:

* Uploading reports from the client to the aggregators
* Computing the results of a given measurement
* Reporting results to the collector

## Task Configuration {#task-configuration}

Each endpoint in the system must agree on the configuration for each
task, which is defined using the Param structure:

~~~
struct {
  opaque uuid[16];
  Aggregator aggregators<1..2^16-1>;
  HpkeConfig collector_config;
  uint64 batch_size;
  Duration batch_window;
  Proto proto;
  uint16 length; // Length of the remainder.
  select (ClientParam.proto) {
    case prio: PrioParam;
    case hits: HitsParam;
  }
} Param;

enum { prio(0), hits(1) } Proto;

Duration uint64; /* Number of seconds elapsed between two instants */

Time uint64; /* seconds elapsed since start of UNIX epoch */
~~~

* `uuid`: A unique sequence of bytes used to ensure that two otherwise
  identical `Param` instances will have distinct `TaskID`s. It is
  RECOMMENDED that this be set to a random 16-byte string derived from a
  cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
* `aggregators`: Vector of `Aggregator` structures (defined below) describing
  the participating aggregators.
* `collector_config`: The HPKE configuration of the collector (described in
  {{key-config}}). Putting the collector's HPKE configuration directly in
  `struct PPMParam` absolves collectors of the burden of operating an HTTP
  server. See [#102](https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-documents/issues/102)
  for discussion.
* `batch_size`: The batch size, i.e., the minimum number of reports that are
  aggregated into an output.
* `batch_window`: The window of time covered by a batch, i.e., the maximum
  interval between the oldest and newest report in a batch.
* `proto`: The PPM protocol, e.g., Prio or Hits. The rest of the structure
  contains the protocol specific parameters.

An `Aggregator` is structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  AggregatorId id;
  Url endpoint;
} Aggregator;

uint64 AggregatorId;

AggregatorId leader_aggregator_id = 0;

opaque Url<1..2^16-1>;
~~~

* `id`: An identifier for the aggregator, used in HPKE encryption and which
  allows participants to resolve entries in `Param.aggregators` against values
  in vectors in other protocol messages. The same `AggregatorId`s MUST be used
  when constructing other messages containing vectors with one value for each
  aggregator (e.g., `Report.encrypted_input_shares` in {{uploading-reports}}).
  Each aggregator knows its own `id`. `id` values MUST be unique in a `Param`
  but may have different meanings in different `Param`s.
* `endpoint`: The URL relative to which an aggregator's API endpoints can be
  found.
* `leader_aggregator_id` is a reserved `AggregatorId` identifying the leader.
  `leader_aggregator_id` MUST occur exactly once among the `aggregators` in a
  `Param`. A `Param` structure without the `leader_aggregator_id` is considered
  malformed and MUST be ignored by clients.

The *task ID* is derived from the PPM parameters as:

~~~
task_id = SHA-256(param)
~~~

Where param is the serialization of Param.


## Uploading Reports {#uploading-reports}

Clients periodically upload reports to the leader, which then distributes
the individual shares to each helper.

### Key Configuration Request {#key-config}

Before the client can upload its report to the leader, it must know the keys of
each of the aggregators. These are retrieved from each aggregator by sending a
request to `Param.aggregators[i].endpoint/key_config` for `0 <= i <
len(Param.aggregators)`. The aggregator responds to well-formed requests with
status 200 and an `HpkeConfig` value:

~~~
struct {
  HpkeConfigId id;
  HpkeKemId kem_id;
  HpkeKdfId kdf_id;
  HpkeAeadKdfId aead_id;
  HpkePublicKey public_key;
} HpkeConfig;

uint8 HpkeConfigId;
opaque HpkePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
uint16 HpkeAeadId; // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
uint16 HpkeKemId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
uint16 HpkeKdfId;  // Defined in I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke
~~~

[OPEN ISSUE: Decide whether to expand the width of the id, or support multiple cipher suites (a la OHTTP/ECH).]

The client aborts if any of the following happen for any `key_config` request:

* the client and aggregator failed to establish a secure,
  aggregator-authenticated channel;
* the GET request failed or didn't return a valid key config; or
* the key config specifies a KEM, KDF, or AEAD algorithm the client doesn't
  recognize.

Aggregators SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit client-side caching of this
resource {{!RFC5861}}. Aggregators SHOULD favor long cache lifetimes to avoid
frequent cache revalidation, e.g., on the order of days. Aggregators can control
this cached lifetime with the Cache-Control header, as follows:

~~~
  Cache-Control: max-age=86400
~~~

Clients SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching {{!RFC7234}} semantics for
key configurations.

Note: Long cache lifetimes may result in clients using stale HPKE
keys; aggregators SHOULD continue to accept reports with old
keys for at least twice the cache lifetime in order to avoid
rejecting reports.

### Upload Request

Let `[leader]` be the `Aggregator.endpoint` of the entry in `Param.aggregators`
with `Aggregator.id == leader_aggregator_id`. Clients upload reports by using
an HTTP POST to `[leader]/upload`. The payload is structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  Time time;
  uint64 nonce;
  Extension extensions<4..2^16-1>;
  EncryptedInputShare encrypted_input_shares<1..2^16-1>;
} Report;
~~~

This message is called the client's *report*. It contains the following fields:

* `task_id` is the task ID of the task for which the report is intended.
* `time` is the time at which the report was generated. This field is used by
  the aggregators to ensure the report appears in at most one batch. (See
  {{anti-replay}}.)
* `nonce` is a random number chosen by the client generating the report. This
  and the timestamp field are used by the aggregators to ensure that each report
  appears at most once in a batch. (See {{anti-replay}}.)
* `extensions` is a list of extensions to be included in the Upload flow; see
  {{upload-extensions}}.
* `encrypted_input_shares` contains the encrypted input shares of each of the
  aggregators. The `aggregator_id` in each `EncryptedInputShare` MUST be one of
  the `Aggregator.id`s in `Param.aggregators`.

[OPEN ISSUE: consider dropping nonce altogether and relying on a more fine-grained timestamp, subject to collision analysis]

Encrypted input shares are structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  AggregatorId aggregator_id;
  HpkeConfigId config_id;
  opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;
  opaque payload<1..2^16-1>;
} EncryptedInputShare;
~~~

* `aggregator_id` is the `id` of the `Aggregator` receiving the input share.
* `config_id` is equal to `HpkeConfig.id`, where `HpkeConfig` is the key config
  of the aggregator receiving the input share.
* `enc` is the encapsulated HPKE context, used by the aggregator to decrypt its
  input share.
* `payload` is the encrypted input share.

To generate the report, the client begins by encoding its measurements as an
input for the PPM scheme and splitting it into input shares. (Note that the
structure of each input share depends on the PPM scheme in use, its parameters,
and the role of aggregator, i.e., whether the aggregator is a leader or helper.)
To encrypt an input share, the client first generates an HPKE
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}} context for the aggregator by running

~~~
enc, context = SetupBaseS(pk, "pda input share" || task_id || aggregator_id)
~~~

where `pk` is the aggregator's public key, `task_id` is `Report.task_id` and
`aggregator_id` is the `Aggregator.id` of the aggregator receiving the input
share. `enc` is the encapsulated HPKE context and `context` is the HPKE context
used by the client for encryption. The payload is encrypted as

~~~
payload = context.Seal(time || nonce || extensions, input_share)
~~~

where `input_share` is the aggregator's input share and `time` and
`nonce` are the corresponding fields of `Report`.

The leader responds to well-formed requests to `[leader]/upload` with status 200
and an empty body. Malformed requests are handled as described in {{errors}}.
Clients SHOULD NOT upload the same measurement value in more than one report if
the leader responds with status 200 and an empty body.

The leader responds to requests with out-of-date `HpkeConfig.id` values, indicated
by `EncryptedInputShare.config_id`, with status 400 and an error of type
'outdatedConfig'. Clients SHOULD invalidate any cached aggregator `HpkeConfig` and
retry with a freshly generated Report. If this retried report does not succeed,
clients MUST abort and discontinue retrying.

### Upload Extensions {#upload-extensions}

Each UploadReq carries a list of extensions that clients may use to convey
additional, authenticated information in the report. Each extension is a tag-length
encoded value of the following form:

~~~
  struct {
      ExtensionType extension_type;
      opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
  } Extension;

  enum {
      TBD(0),
      (65535)
  } ExtensionType;
~~~

"extension_type" indicates the type of extension, and "extension_data" contains
information specific to the extension.


## Verifying and Aggregating Reports {#pa-aggregate}

Once a set of clients have uploaded their reports to the leader, the leader
can send them to the helpers to be verified and aggregated. In order
to enable the system to handle very large batches of reports, this process
can be performed incrementally. To aggregate a set of reports,
the leader sends an AggregateReq to each helper containing those report
shares. The helper then processes them (verifying
the proofs and incorporating their values into the ongoing aggregate)
and replies to the leader.

The exact structure of the aggregation flow depends on the PPM
scheme. Specifically:

* Some PPM schemes (e.g., Prio) allow the leader to start aggregating
reports proactively before all the reports in a batch are received.
Others (e.g., Hits) require all the reports to be present and
must be initiated by the collector.

* Processing the reports -- especially verifying the proofs -- may
require multiple round trips.

Note that it is possible to aggregate reports from one batch while
reports from the next batch are coming in.

This process is illustrated below in {{pa-aggregate-flow}}. In this example,
the batch size is 20, but the leader opts to process the reports in
sub-batches of 10. Each sub-batch takes two round-trips to process.
Once both sub-batches have been processed, the leader can issue
an OutputShareReq in order to retrieve the helper's aggregated result.

In order to allow the helpers to retain minimal state, the helper can attach a
state parameter to its response, with the leader returning the state
value in the next request, thus offloading the state to the
leader. This state value MUST be cryptographically protected as
described in {{helper-state}}.

[[OPEN ISSUE: Should there be an indication of whether
  a given AggregateReq is a continuation of a previous sub-batch]]
[TODO: Decide if and how the collector's request is authenticated.]


### Aggregate Request

The AggregateReq request is used by the leader to send a set of reports
to the helper. These reports MUST all be associated with the same PPM task.
[[OPEN ISSUE: And the same batch, right?]]

Let `Param` denote the PPM parameters structure associated with
`AggregateReq.task_id`. For each `aggregator` in `Param.aggregators` where
`aggregator.id != leader_aggregator_id`, the leader sends a POST request to
`aggregator.endpoint/aggregate` with the following message:

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  opaque helper_state<0..2^16>;
  AggregateSubReq seq<1..2^24-1>;
} AggregateReq;
~~~

The structure contains the PPM task, an opaque *helper state* string, and a
sequence of *sub-requests*, each corresponding to a unique client report.
Sub-requests are structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  Time time;                       // Equal to Report.time.
  uint64 nonce;                    // Equal to Report.nonce.
  Extension extensions<4..2^16-1>; // Equal to Report.extensions.
  EncryptedInputShare helper_share;
  select (Param.proto) { // Param for the PPM task
    case prio: PrioAggregateSubReq;
    case hits: HitsAggregateSubReq;
  }
} AggregateSubReq;
~~~

The `time`, `nonce`, and `extensions` fields have the same value as those in the
report uploaded by the client. Similarly, the `helper_share` field is the
`EncryptedInputShare` from the `Report` whose `aggregator_id` matches
`aggregator.id`. [OPEN ISSUE: We usually only need to send this in the
first aggregate request. Shall we exclude it in subsequent requests somehow?]
The remainder of the structure is dedicated to the protocol-specific request
parameters.

In order to provide replay protection, the leader is required to send aggregate
sub-requests in ascending order, where the ordering on sub-requests is
determined by the algorithm defined in {{anti-replay}}. Specifically, the leader
constructs its request such that:

* each sub-request follows the previous sub-request; and
* the first sub-request follows the last sub-request in the previous aggregate
  request.

The helper handles well-formed requests as follows. (As usual, malformed
requests are handled as described in {{errors}}.) It first looks
for the PPM parameters `Param` for which `AggregateReq.task_id` is equal
to the task ID derived from `Param`. It then filters out out-of-order
sub-requests by ignoring any sub-request that does not follow the previous one
(See {{anti-replay}}.)

The response is an HTTP 200 OK with a body consisting of the helper's updated
state and a sequence of *sub-responses*, where the j-th sub-response corresponds
to the j-th sub-request for each `1 <= j <= len(AggregateReq.seq)`. The
structure of each sub-response is specific to the PPM protocol:

~~~
struct {
  opaque helper_state<0..2^16>;
  AggregateSubResp seq<1..2^24-1>;
} AggregateResp;

struct {
  Time time;     // Equal to AggregateSubReq.time.
  uint64 nonce;  // Equal to AggregateSubReq.nonce.
  select (Param.proto) { // Param for the PPM task
    case prio: PrioAggregateSubResp;
    case hits: HitsAggregateSubResp;
  }
} AggregateSubResp;
~~~

The helper handles each sub-request `AggregateSubReq` as follows. It first
looks up the HPKE config and corresponding secret key associated with
`helper_share.config_id`. If not found, then the sub-response consists of an
"unrecognized config" alert. [TODO: We'll want to be more precise about what
this means. See issue#57.] Next, it attempts to decrypt the payload with the
following procedure:

~~~
context = SetupBaseR(helper_share.enc, sk,
                     "pda input share" || task_id || aggregator_id)
input_share = context.Open(time || nonce || extensions, helper_share)
~~~

where `sk` is the HPKE secret key, `task_id` is `AggregateReq.task_id` and
`aggregator_id` is the `AggregatorId` for the aggregator. `time`, `nonce` and
`extensions` are obtained from the corresponding fields in `AggregateSubReq`. If
decryption fails, then the sub-response consists of a "decryption error" alert.
[See issue#57.] Otherwise, the helper handles the request for its plaintext
input share `input_share` and updates its state as specified by the PPM
protocol.

After processing all of the sub-requests, the helper encrypts its updated state
and constructs its response to the aggregate request.

#### Leader State

The leader is required to issue aggregate requests in order, but reports are
likely to arrive out-of-order. The leader SHOULD buffer reports for a time
period proportional to the batch window before issuing the first aggregate
request. Failure to do so will result in out-of-order reports being dropped by
the helper.

#### Helper State

The helper state is an optional parameter of an aggregate request that the
helper can use to carry state across requests. At least part of the state will
usually need to be encrypted in order to protect user privacy. However, the
details of precisely how the state is encrypted and the information that it
carries is up to the helper implementation.

### Output Share Request {#output-share-request}

Once the aggregators have verified at least as many reports as required for the
PPM task, the leader issues an *output share request* to each helper. The helper
responds to this request by extracting its output share from its state and
encrypting it under the collector's HPKE public key.

Let `Param` denote the PPM parameters structure associated with the task. For
each `aggregator` in `Param.aggregators` where
`aggregator.id != leader_aggregator_id`, the leader sends a POST request to
`aggregator.endpoint/output_share` with the following message:

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  Time batch_start; // Same as CollectReq.batch_start.
  Time batch_end;   // Same as CollectReq.batch_end.
  opaque helper_state<0..2^16>;
} OutputShareReq;
~~~

To respond to valid output share requests, the helper first checks that the
request corresponds to a valid collect request. Next, it extracts from its state
the set of input shares that fall in the window `[batch_start, batch_end)`. If
the size of the batch is less than `task.batch_size`, then it aborts and alerts
the leader with "insufficient data". Otherwise, it computes its output share,
which has the following structure:

~~~
struct {
  select (Param.proto) { // Param corresponding to CollectReq.task_id
    case prio: PrioOutputShare;
    case hits: HitsOutputShare;
  }
} OutputShare;
~~~

Next, the helper encrypts its output share under the collector's HPKE public
key:

~~~
enc, context = SetupBaseS(pk, "pda output share" || task_id || aggregator_id)
encrypted_output_share = context.Seal(batch_start || batch_end, output_share)
~~~

where `pk` is the HPKE public key encoded by the collector's HPKE key
configuration, `task_id` is `OutputShareReq.task_id` and `aggregator_id` is the
`AggregatorId` of the server. `output_share` is the serialized `OutputShare`.
`batch_start` and `batch_end` are obtained from the `OutputShareReq`.

This encryption prevents the leader from learning the actual result, as it only
has its own share and not the helper's share, which is encrypted for the
collector. The helper responds to the collector with HTTP status 200 OK and a
body consisting of the following structure:

~~~
struct {
  AggregatorId aggregator_id;
  HpkeConfigId collector_hpke_config_id;
  opaque enc<1..2^16-1>;
  opaque encrypted_output_share<1..2^16>;
} EncryptedOutputShare;
~~~

* `aggregator_id` is the `AggregatorId` of the aggregator constructing the
  output share.
* `collector_hpke_config_id` is `collector_config.id` from the `Param`
  corresponding to `CollectReq.task_id`.
* `enc` is the encapsulated HPKE context, used by the collector to decrypt the
  output share.
* `encrypted_output_share` is an encrypted `OutputShare`, whose structure is
  given below.

The leader uses the helper's output share response to respond to the collector's
collect request (see {{pa-collect}}).


## Collecting Results {#pa-collect}

The collector uses CollectReq to ask the leader to collect and return
the results for a given PPM task over a given time period. To make
a collect request, the collector issues a POST request to
`[leader]/collect`, where `[leader]` is the leader's endpoint URL. The
body of the request is structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  TaskID task_id;
  Time batch_start;  // The beginning of the batch.
  Time batch_end;    // The end of the batch (exclusive).
  select (Param.proto) { // Param corresponding to task_id
    case prio: PrioCollectReq;
    case hits: HitsCollectReq;
  }
} CollectReq;
~~~

[[TODO: Define the fields]]

Depending on the PPM scheme and how the leader is configured, the CollectReq may cause
the leader to send a series of AggregateReqs to the helpers in
order to compute the aggregate. Alternately, the leader may already
have computed the results and can return them immediately.
In either case, once the leader has obtained the helper's
encrypted output share for the batch, it responds to the collector's request
with HTTP status 200 and a body consisting of a CollectResp message:

[[OPEN ISSUE: What happens if this all takes a really long time.]]
[TODO: Decide if and how the collector's request is authenticated.]

~~~
struct {
  EncryptedOutputShare shares<1..2^16-1>;
} CollectResp;
~~~

* `shares` is a vector of `EncryptedOutputShare`s, as described in
  {{output-share-request}}, except that for the leader's share, the `task_id`,
  `batch_start`, and `batch_end` used to encrypt the `OutputShare` are obtained
  from the `CollectReq`, and the `aggregator_id` is `leader_aggregator_id`.

[OPEN ISSUE: Describe how intra-protocol errors yield collect errors (see
issue#57). For example, how does a leader respond to a collect request if the
helper drops out?]


# Operational Considerations {#operational-capabilities}

PPM protocols have inherent constraints derived from the tradeoff between privacy
guarantees and computational complexity. These tradeoffs influence how
applications may choose to utilize services implementing the specification.

## Protocol participant capabilities {#entity-capabilities}

The design in this document has different assumptions and requirements for
different protocol participants, including clients, aggregators, and
collectors. This section describes these capabilities in more detail.

### Client capabilities

Clients have limited capabilities and requirements. Their only inputs to the protocol
are (1) the Param structure configured out of band and (2) a measurement. Clients
are not expected to store any state across any upload
flows, nor are they required to implement any sort of report upload retry mechanism.
By design, the protocol in this document is robust against individual client upload
failures since the protocol output is an aggregate over all inputs.

### Aggregator capabilities

Helpers and leaders have different operational requirements. The design in this
document assumes an operationally competent leader, i.e., one that has no storage
or computation limitations or constraints, but only a modestly provisioned helper, i.e., one that
has computation, bandwidth, and storage constraints. By design, leaders must be
at least as capable as helpers, where helpers are generally required to:

- Support the collect protocol, which includes verifying and aggregating
  sets of reports in a given batch; and
- Publish and manage an HPKE configuration that can be used for the upload protocol.

In addition, for each Param instance, helpers are required to:

- Implement some form of batch-to-report index, as well as inter- and intra-batch
  replay mitigation storage, which includes some way of tracking batch report size
  with optional support for state offloading. Some of this state may be used for
  replay attack mitigation. The replay mitigation strategy is described in {{anti-replay}}.

Beyond the minimal capabilities required of helpers, leaders are generally required to:

- Support the upload protocol and store client reports for a given Param instance,
  where each report maps uniquely to a single batch, and index this storage by batch durations;
- Track batch report size during each collect flow and request encrypted output shares
  from helpers.

In addition, for each Param instance, leaders are required to:

- Implement and store state for the form of inter- and intra-batch replay mitigation in {{anti-replay}}; and
- Store helper state associated with a given Param batch.

### Collector capabilities

Collectors statefully interact with aggregators to produce an aggregate output. Their
input to the protocol is the Param structure, configured out of band, which contains
the corresponding batch window and size. For each collect invocation, collectors are
required to keep state from the start of the protocol to the end as needed to produce
the final aggregate output.

Collectors must also maintain state for the lifetime of each Param value, which includes
key material associated with the HPKE key configuration.

## Data resolution limitations

Privacy comes at the cost of computational complexity. While affine-aggregatable
encodings (AFEs) can compute many useful statistics, they require more bandwidth
and CPU cycles to account for finite-field arithmetic during input-validation.
The increased work from verifying inputs decreases the throughput of the system
or the inputs processed per unit time. Throughput is related to the verification
circuit's complexity and the available compute-time to each aggregator.

Applications that utilize proofs with a large number of multiplication gates or
a high frequency of inputs may need to limit inputs into the system to meet
bandwidth or compute constraints. Some methods of overcoming these limitations
include choosing a better representation for the data or introducing sampling
into the data collection methodology.

[[TODO: Discuss explicit key performance indicators, here or elsewhere.]]

## Aggregation utility and soft batch deadlines

A soft real-time system should produce a response within a deadline to
be useful. This constraint may be relevant when the value of an aggregate
decreases over time. A missed deadline can reduce an aggregate's utility
but not necessarily cause failure in the system.

An example of a soft real-time constraint is the expectation that input data can
be verified and aggregated in a period equal to data collection, given some
computational budget. Meeting these deadlines will require efficient
implementations of the input-validation protocol. Applications might batch
requests or utilize more efficient serialization to improve throughput.

Some applications may be constrained by the time that it takes to reach a
privacy threshold defined by a minimum number of input shares. One possible
solution is to increase the reporting period so more samples can be collected,
balanced against the urgency of responding to a soft deadline.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

Prio assumes a powerful adversary with the ability to compromise an unbounded
number of clients. In doing so, the adversary can provide malicious (yet
truthful) inputs to the aggregation function. Prio also assumes that all but one
server operates honestly, where a dishonest server does not execute the protocol
faithfully as specified. The system also assumes that servers communicate over
secure and mutually authenticated channels. In practice, this can be done by TLS
or some other form of application-layer authentication.

In the presence of this adversary, Prio provides two important properties for
computing an aggregation function F:

1. Privacy. The aggregators and collector learn only the output of F computed
   over all client inputs, and nothing else.
1. Robustness. As long as the aggregators execute the input-validation protocol
   correctly, a malicious client can skew the output of F only by reporting
   false (untruthful) input. The output cannot be influenced in any other way.

There are several additional constraints that a Prio deployment must satisfy in
order to achieve these goals:

1. Minimum batch size. The aggregation batch size has an obvious impact on
   privacy. (A batch size of one hides nothing of the input.)
2. Aggregation function choice. Some aggregation functions leak slightly more
   than the function output itself.

[TODO: discuss these in more detail.]

## Threat model

In this section, we enumerate the actors participating in the Prio system and
enumerate their assets (secrets that are either inherently valuable or which
confer some capability that enables further attack on the system), the
capabilities that a malicious or compromised actor has, and potential
mitigations for attacks enabled by those capabilities.

This model assumes that all participants have previously agreed upon and
exchanged all shared parameters over some unspecified secure channel.

### Client/user

#### Assets

1. Unshared inputs. Clients are the only actor that can ever see the original
   inputs.
1. Unencrypted input shares.

#### Capabilities

1. Individual users can reveal their own input and compromise their own privacy.
1. Clients (that is, software which might be used by many users of the system)
can defeat privacy by leaking input outside of the Prio system.
1. Clients may affect the quality of aggregations by reporting false input.
     * Prio can only prove that submitted input is valid, not that it is true.
       False input can be mitigated orthogonally to the Prio protocol (e.g., by
       requiring that aggregations include a minimum number of contributions)
       and so these attacks are considered to be outside of the threat model.
1. Clients can send invalid encodings of input.

#### Mitigations

1. The input validation protocol executed by the aggregators prevents either
individual clients or coalitions of clients from compromising the robustness
property.
1. If aggregator output satisifes differential privacy {{dp}}, then all records
not leaked by malicious clients are still protected.

### Aggregator

#### Assets

1. Unencrypted input shares.
1. Input share decryption keys.
1. Client identifying information.
1. Output shares.
1. Aggregator identity.

#### Capabilities

1. Aggregators may defeat the robustness of the system by emitting bogus output
   shares.
1. If clients reveal identifying information to aggregators (such as a trusted
   identity during client authentication), aggregators can learn which clients
   are contributing input.
     1. Aggregators may reveal that a particular client contributed input.
     1. Aggregators may attack robustness by selectively omitting inputs from
        certain clients.
          * For example, omitting submissions from a particular geographic
            region to falsely suggest that a particular localization is not
            being used.
1. Individual aggregators may compromise availability of the system by refusing
to emit output shares.
1. Input validity proof forging. Any aggregator can collude with a malicious
client to craft a proof that will fool honest aggregators into accepting
invalid input.

#### Mitigations

1. The linear secret sharing scheme employed by the client ensures that privacy
   is preserved as long as at least one aggregator does not reveal its input
   shares.
1. If computed over a sufficient number of input shares, output shares reveal
   nothing about either the inputs or the participating clients.

### Leader

The leader is also an aggregator, and so all the assets, capabilities and
mitigations available to aggregators also apply to the leader.

#### Capabilities

1. Input validity proof verification. The leader can forge proofs and collude
   with a malicious client to trick aggregators into aggregating invalid inputs.
     * This capability is no stronger than any aggregator's ability to forge
       validity proof in collusion with a malicious client.
1. Relaying messages between aggregators. The leader can compromise availability
   by dropping messages.
     * This capability is no stronger than any aggregator's ability to refuse to
       emit output shares.
1. Shrinking the anonymity set. The leader instructs aggregators to construct
   output parts and so could request aggregations over few inputs.

#### Mitigations

1. Aggregators enforce agreed upon minimum aggregation thresholds to prevent
   deanonymizing.
1. If aggregator output satisifes differential privacy {{dp}}, then genuine
   records are protected regardless of the size of the anonymity set.

### Collector

#### Capabilities

1. Advertising shared configuration parameters (e.g., minimum thresholds for
   aggregations, joint randomness, arithmetic circuits).
1. Collectors may trivially defeat availability by discarding output shares
   submitted by aggregators.
1. Known input injection. Collectors may collude with clients to send known
   input to the aggregators, allowing collectors to shrink the effective
   anonymity set by subtracting the known inputs from the final output.
   Sybil attacks {{JD02}} could be used to amplify this capability.

#### Mitigations

1. Aggregators should refuse shared parameters that are trivially insecure
   (i.e., aggregation threshold of 1 contribution).
1. If aggregator output satisifes differential privacy {{dp}}, then genuine
   records are protected regardless of the size of the anonymity set.

### Aggregator collusion

If all aggregators collude (e.g. by promiscuously sharing unencrypted input
shares), then none of the properties of the system hold. Accordingly, such
scenarios are outside of the threat model.

### Attacker on the network

We assume the existence of attackers on the network links between participants.

#### Capabilities

1. Observation of network traffic. Attackers may observe messages exchanged
   between participants at the IP layer.
     1. The time of transmission of input shares by clients could reveal
        information about user activity.
          * For example, if a user opts into a new feature, and the client
            immediately reports this to aggregators, then just by observing
            network traffic, the attacker can infer what the user did.
     1. Observation of message size could allow the attacker to learn how much
        input is being submitted by a client.
          * For example, if the attacker observes an encrypted message of some
            size, they can infer the size of the plaintext, plus or minus the
            cipher block size. From this they may be able to infer which
            aggregations the user has opted into or out of.
1. Tampering with network traffic. Attackers may drop messages or inject new
   messages into communications between participants.

#### Mitigations

1. All messages exchanged between participants in the system should be
   encrypted.
1. All messages exchanged between aggregators, the collector and the leader
   should be mutually authenticated so that network attackers cannot impersonate
   participants.
1. Clients should be required to submit inputs at regular intervals so that the
   timing of individual messages does not reveal anything.
1. Clients should submit dummy inputs even for aggregations the user has not
   opted into.

[[OPEN ISSUE: The threat model for Prio --- as it's described in the original
paper and [BBG+19] --- considers **either** a malicious client (attacking
soundness) **or** a malicious subset of aggregators (attacking privacy). In
particular, soundness isn't guaranteed if any one of the aggregators is
malicious; in theory it may be possible for a malicious client and aggregator to
collude and break soundness. Is this a contingency we need to address? There are
techniques in [BBG+19] that account for this; we need to figure out if they're
practical.]]

## Client authentication or attestation

[TODO: Solve issue#89]

## Anonymizing proxies {#anon-proxy}

Client reports can contain auxiliary information such as source IP, HTTP user
agent or in deployments which use it, client authentication information, which
could be used by aggregators to identify participating clients or permit some
attacks on robustness. This auxiliary information could be removed by having
clients submit reports to an anonymizing proxy server which would then use
Oblivous HTTP {{!I-D.thomson-http-oblivious}} to forward inputs to the PPM
leader, without requiring any server participating in PPM to be aware of
whatever client authentication or attestation scheme is in use.

## Batch sizes and privacy

An important parameter of a PPM deployment is the minimum batch size. If an
aggregation includes too few inputs, then the outputs can reveal information
about individual participants. Aggregators use the batch size field of the
`Params` structure to enforce minimum batch size during the collect protocol,
but server implementations may also opt out of participating in a PPM task if
the minimum batch size is too small. This document does not specify how to
choose minimum batch sizes.

## Differential privacy {#dp}

Optionally, PPM deployments can choose to ensure their output F achieves
differential privacy {{SV16}}. A simple approach would require the aggregators
to add two-sided noise (e.g. sampled from a two-sided geometric distribution)
to outputs. Since each aggregator is adding noise independently, privacy can be
guaranteed even if all but one of the aggregators is malicious. Differential
privacy is a strong privacy definition, and protects users in extreme
circumstances: Even if an adversary has prior knowledge of every input in a
batch except for one, that one record is still formally protected.

[OPEN ISSUE: While parameters configuring the differential privacy noise (like
specific distributions / variance) can be agreed upon out of band by the
aggregators and collector, there may be benefits to adding explicit protocol
support by encoding them into `Params`.]

## Multiple protocol runs

Prio is _robust_ against malicious clients, and _private_ against malicious
servers, but cannot provide robustness against malicious servers. Any aggregator
can simply emit bogus output shares and undetectably spoil aggregates. If enough
aggregators were available, this could be mitigated by running the protocol
multiple times with distinct subsets of aggregators chosen so that no aggregator
appears in all subsets and checking all the outputs against each other. If all
the protocol runs do not agree, then participants know that at least one
aggregator is defective, and it may be possible to identify the defector (i.e.,
if a majority of runs agree, and a single aggregator appears in every run that
disagrees). See
[#22](https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-documents/issues/22) for
discussion.

## Infrastructure diversity

Prio deployments should ensure that aggregators do not have common dependencies
that would enable a single vendor to reassemble inputs. For example, if all
participating aggregators stored unencrypted input shares on the same cloud
object storage service, then that cloud vendor would be able to reassemble all
the input shares and defeat privacy.

#### Anti-replay {#anti-replay}

Using a report in multiple batches, or multiple times within a single batch, is
considered a privacy violation, since it may leak more information about that
report than intended by the PPM protocol. For example, this may violate
differential privacy. To mitigate this issue, the core specification imposes an
ordering on reports so that aggregators can cheaply prevent replays attacks.

Aggregate requests are ordered as follows: We say that a report `R2` follows
report `R1` if either `R2.time > R1.time` or `R2.time == R1.time` and
`R2.nonce > R1.nonce`. If `R2.time < R1.time`, or `R2.time == R1.time` but
`R2.nonce <= R1.nonce`, then we say that `R2` does not follow `R1`.

To prevent replay attacks, each aggregator ensures that each report it consumes
follows the previous one it consumed. To prevent the adversary from tampering
with the ordering of reports, honest clients incorporate the ordering-sensitive
parameters `(time, nonce)` into the AAD for HPKE encryption. Note that this
strategy may result in dropping reports that happen to have the same timestamp
and nonce value.

Aggregators prevent the same report from being used in multiple batches by only
consuming valid collect requests, as described in {{pa-collect}}.

## Definition flow

Each PPM task consists of two sub-protocols, *upload* and *collect*, which are
executed concurrently. Each sub-protocol consists of a sequence of HTTP requests
made from one entity to another.


## Private aggregation via secret sharing

The main cryptographic tool used for achieving this privacy goal is *additive
secret sharing*. Rather than send its input in the clear, each client splits
its measurements into a sequence of *shares* and sends a share to each of the
aggregators. Additive secret sharing has two important properties:

- It's impossible to deduce the measurement without knowing *all* of the shares.
- It allows the aggregators to compute the final output by first adding up their
  measurements shares locally, then combining the results to obtain the final
  output.

Consider an illustrative example. Suppose there are three clients and two
aggregators. Each client `i` holds a single measurement in the form of a
positive integer `x[i]`, and our goal is to compute the sum of the measurements
of all clients. In this case, the protocol input is a single measurement
consisting of a single positive integer; no additional encoding is done. Given
this input, the first client splits its measurement `x[1]` with additive
secret-sharing into a pair of integers `X[1,1]` and `X[1,2]` for which `x[1]` is
equal to `X[1,1] + X[1,2]` modulo a prime number `p`. (For convenience, we will
omit the mod `p` operator in the rest of this section.) It then uploads `X[1,1]`
to one server and `X[1,2]` to the other. The second client splits its
measurement `x[2]` into `X[1,2]` and `X[2,2]`, uploads them to the servers, and
so on.

Now the first aggregator is in possession of shares `X[1,1]`, `X[2,1]`, and
`X[3,1]` and the second aggregator is in possession of shares `X[2,1]`,
`X[2,2]`, and `X[2,3]`. Each aggregator computes the sum of its shares; let
`A[1]` denote the first aggregator's share of the sum and let `A[2]` denote the
second aggregator's share of the sum. In the last step, aggregators combine
their sum shares to obtain the final output `y = A[1] + A[2]`. This is correct
because modular addition is commutative. I.e.,

~~~
    y = A[1] + A[2]
      = (x[1,1] + x[2,1] + x[3,1]) + (x[1,2] + x[2,2] + x[3,2])
      = (x[1,1] + x[1,2]) + (x[2,1] + x[2,2]) + (x[3,1] + x[3,2])
      = x[1] + x[2] + x[3]
      = F(x[1], x[2], x[3])
~~~

### Prio {#prio-variant}

This approach can be used to privately compute any function `F` that can be
expressed as a function of the sum of the users' inputs. In Prio {{CB17}}, each
user splits its input into shares and sends each share to one of the
aggregators. The aggregators sum up their input shares. Once all the shares have
been aggregated, they combine their shares of the aggregate to get the final
output.

Not all aggregate functions can be expressed this way efficiently, however. Prio
supports only a limited set of aggregation functions, some of which we highlight
below:

- Simple statistics, like sum, mean, min, max, variance, and standard deviation;
- Histograms with fixed bin sizes (also allows estimation of quantiles, e.g.,
  the median);
- More advanced statistics, like linear regression;
- Bitwise-OR and -AND on bit strings; and
- Computation of data structures, like Bloom filters, counting Bloom filters,
  and count-min sketches, that approximately represent (multi-)sets of strings.

This variety of aggregate types is sufficient to support a wide variety of
data aggregation tasks.

### Hits {#hits-variant}

A common PPM task that can't be solved efficiently with Prio is the
`t`-*heavy-hitters* problem {{BBCp21}}. In this setting, each user is in
possession of a single `n`-bit string, and the goal is to compute the compute
the set of strings that occur at least `t` times. One reason that Prio doesn't
apply to this problem is that the proof generated by the client would be huge.

[TODO: Provide an overview of the protocol of {{BBCp21}} and provide some
intuition about how additive secret sharing is used.]



## Parameters

### Finite field arithmetic

The algorithms that comprise the input-validation protocol --- Prove, Query, and
Decide --- are constructed by generating and evaluating polynomials over a
finite field. As such, the main ingredient of Prio is an implementation of
arithmetic in a finite field suitable for the given application.

We will use a prime field. The choice of prime is influenced by the following
criteria:

1. **Field size.** How big the field needs to be depends on the type of data
   being aggregated and how many users there are. The field size also impacts
   the security level: the longer the validity circuit, the larger the field
   needs to be in order to effectively detect malicious clients. Typically the
   soundness error (i.e., the probability of an invalid input being deemed valid
   by the aggregators) will be 2n/(p-n), where n is the size of the input and p
   is the prime modulus.
1. **Fast polynomial operations.** In order to make Prio practical, it's
   important that implementations employ FFT to speed up polynomial operations.
   In particular, the prime modulus p should be chosen so that `(p-1) = 2^b * s`
   for large `b` and odd `s`. Then `g^s` is a principle, `2^b`-th root of unity
   (i.e., `g^(s\*2^b) = 1`), where `g` is the generator of the multiplicative
   subgroup.
   This fact allows us to quickly evaluate and interpolate polynomials at
   `2^a`-th roots of unity for any `1 <= a <= b`. Note that `b` imposes an upper
   bound on the size of proofs, so it should be large enough to accommodate all
   foreseeable use cases. Something like `b >= 20` is probably good enough.
1. **As close to a power of two as possible.** We use rejection sampling to map
   a PRNG seed to a pseudorandom sequence of field elements (see {{prio-prng}).
   In order to minimize the probability of a simple being rejected, the modulus
   should be as close to a power of 2 as possible.
1. **Code optimization.** [[TODO: What properties of the field make
   it possible to write faster implementations?]]

The table below lists parameters that meet these criteria at various
levels of security. The "size" column indicates the number of bits
required to represent elements of the field.

| # | size | p                                      | g  | b   | s                |
|---|------|----------------------------------------|----|-----|------------------|
| 1 | 32   | 4293918721                             | 19 | 20  | 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 13 |
| 2 | 64   | 15564440312192434177                   | 5  | 59  | 3^3              |
| 3 | 80   | 779190469673491460259841               | 14 | 72  | 3 * 5 * 11       |
| 4 | 123  | 9304595970494411110326649421962412033  | 3  | 120 | 7                |
| 5 | 126  | 74769074762901517850839147140769382401 | 7  | 118 | 3^2 * 5^2        |

[TODO: Choose new parameters for 2, 3, and 5 so that p is as close to 2^size as
possible without going over. (4 is already close enough; 1 is already deployed
and can't be changed.]

**Finding suitable primes.**
One way to find suitable primes is to first choose `b`, then "probe" to find a
prime of the desired size. The following SageMath script prints the parameters
of a number of (probable) primes larger than `2^b` for a given `b`:

~~~
b = 116
for s in range(0,1000,1):
    B = 2^b
    p = (B*s).next_prime()
    if p-(B*s) == 1:
        bits = round(math.log2(p), 2)
        print(bits, p, GF(p).multiplicative_generator(), b, factor(s))
~~~

### Pseudorandom number generation {#prio-prng}

A suitable PRNG will have the following syntax. Fix a finite field `K`:

1. `x := PRNG(k, n)` denotes generation of a vector of `n` elements of `K`.

This can be instantiated using a standard stream cipher, e.g., AES-CTR, as
follows. Interpret the seed `k` as the key and IV for generating the AES-CTR key
stream. Proceed by rejection sampling, as follows. Let `m` be the number of bits
needed to encode an element of `K`. Generate the next `m` bits of key stream and
interpret the bytes as an integer `x`, clearing the most significant `m - l`
bits, where `l` is the bit-length of the modulus `p`. If `x < p`, then output
`x`. Otherwise, generate the next `m` bits of key stream and try again. Repeat
this process indefinitely until a suitable output is found.

## Pre-conditions

We assume the following conditions hold before execution of any PPM task begins:

1. The clients, aggregators, and collector agree on a set of PPM tasks, as well
   as the PPM parameters associated to each task.
1. Each aggregator has a clock that is roughly in sync with true time, i.e.,
   within the batch window specified by the PPM parameters. (This is necessary to
   prevent the same report from appearing in multiple batches.)
1. Each client has selected a PPM task for which it will upload a report. It is
   also configured with the task's parameters.
1. Each client and the leader can establish a leader-authenticated secure
   channel.
1. The leader and each helper can establish a helper-authenticated secure
   channel.
1. The collector and leader can establish a leader-authenticated secure channel.
1. The collector has chosen an HPKE configuration and corresponding secret key.
1. Each aggregator has chosen an HPKE configuration and corresponding secret key.

[TODO: It would be clearer to include a "pre-conditions" section prior to each
"phase" of the protocol.]
